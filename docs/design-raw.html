<h1 class="title">Wii-Track</h1>

<p>In this document, we will give an overview of Wii-Track, describe its overall
system architecture, explain our hackathon implementation, and discuss how this
project could be implemented at an industrial scale.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">General Information</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Wii-Track is a system for package tracking designed for use in a variety of
scenarios such as warehouses. The name Wii-Track comes from the fact that we
used a WiiFit board as our scale for this prototype.</p>
<p>Our overall goal was to make inventory tracking more cost-effective by utilizing
sensors and data analytics to identify inventory items automatically. For the
hackathon, we utilized two metrics (weight and color) to identify objects,
however, we designed the system to scale to any number of additional metrics
such as image recognition and infrared image data.</p>
<p>Our project was inspired by the Dish challenge at the HackCU hackathon. Their
challenge was to create a system for asset tracking which utilized IOT
technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>At a high level, the Wii-Track architecture has three components: edge nodes,
compute nodes, and a data store. User-facing applications can be built on top of
this framework (see <a class="reference internal" href="#hackathon-implementation">Hackathon Implementation</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#industrial-scale-implementation">Industrial Scale
Implementation</a> below).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Edge nodes:</strong> these nodes collect data about items, and send the raw data
to the compute nodes for processing.</li>
<li><strong>Compute nodes:</strong> these nodes process raw data using a variety of analytics.
In our case, these nodes were AWS Lambda functions.</li>
<li><strong>Data store:</strong> this stores information about the inventory and how it is
moving around. For our prototype, we utilized the AWS DynamoDB NoSQL database
to store information about the items we processed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There can be any number of edge nodes and compute nodes, and DynamoDB could be
replaced by any other database.</p>
<p>The overall software architecture is visualized below:</p>
<img alt="img/wii-track-architecture.png" class="align-center" src="img/wii-track-architecture.png" style="width: 80%;" />
<p>Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of considerations we discussed as we designed
our system architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Edge nodes may not have much compute power.</strong> For our prototype, we used a
Raspberry Pi 1 which only has a 600 MHz ARM processor. Starting up the Python
3 interpreter can take over 30 seconds! However, compared to many embedded
devices, the Raspberry Pi has a large amount of compute power.  Operations
such as string manipulation and floating point arithmetic are not possible on
many embedded devices.</p>
<p>This led us to push all of the computation onto AWS Lambda. Edge nodes only
send raw data and we can then utilize the power of the Amazon infrastructure
for data processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Edge nodes may be difficult to update.</strong> These edge nodes may be installed
in low-bandwidth areas and then possibly not replaced for years. It would be
very difficult to add new features if those features required deploying an
update to the edge nodes. Instead, we do almost all computation in lambda
where publishing updates is easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Server administration is hard.</strong> AWS Lambda abstracts the server away, so we
are able to concentrate on code, not deployment. This was great for not only
the HackCU hackathon, but also for scalability in the long term.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The data stored will not be uniform.</strong> If we have many different versions of
edge nodes, the data sent and stored may not be the same across versions. For
example, one version may send image data, while other nodes only have infrared
data. Additionally, the data is not highly relational; relations between data
are derived at an application layer. This variance in data that we need to
store led us to use AWS DynamoDB, a scalable, NoSQL database running on Amazon
infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>
We wanted to, and did, win the <em>Best Use of AWS</em> challenge.
</strong> One of the prizes at HackCU was for the application that best utilized
AWS. This was part of the reason why we used AWS Lambda and AWS DynamoDB. Our
entry into this challenge won.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- This is an ugly hack. I can't easily nest any role inside of a bold, so I'm
doing raw HTML instead... -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="hackathon-implementation">
<h1>Hackathon Implementation</h1>
<p>At HackCU, we implemented a proof of concept for this project. We built a
prototype edge node, compute node, and datastore; a simple GUI client to view
the data in the datastore; and a simple GUI to control the edge node.</p>
<div class="section" id="edge-node">
<h2>Edge Node</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/wii-track/tree/master/arduino"><tt class="docutils literal">arduino</tt></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/wii-track/tree/master/rpi"><tt class="docutils literal">rpi</tt></a> directories and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/wii-track/tree/master/wiiboard.py"><tt class="docutils literal">wiiboard.py</tt></a> file for the edge node
source code.</p>
</div>
<p>We implemented our edge node with two sensors: a scale (the WiiFit board) and a
camera (Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an Arduino-controled servo). The
Raspberry Pi was connected over serial to the Arduino which controlled a servo.
This servo swivelled the camera around. The camera was connected directly to the
Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>We built a client application in Python using Qt which allowed control of the
servo/camera angle and also showed a live image of the package. We also had the
ability to take pictures of the package. Our prototype required user interaction
to take a picture, but ideally, we would trigger this picture when the package
is put on the scale.</p>
<p>The WiiFit board was connected over Bluetooth to one of our computers. We would
have liked to make the Raspberry Pi communicate directly with the WiiFit board,
but this was infeasible since the Raspberry Pi does not have Bluetooth
capabilities. We used the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pierriko/wiiboard"><tt class="docutils literal">wiiboard</tt></a> library to communicate with the WiiFit. It
provided us with a constant stream of data consisting of four data points. Each
data point gave the weight measurement for one of the four quadrants on the
WiiFit board. We sent this data directly to AWS using the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"><tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt></a> library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compute-node">
<h2>Compute Node</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/wii-track/tree/master/color-lambda"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color-lambda</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/wii-track/tree/master/weight-processing-lambda"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weight-processing-lambda</span></tt></a> directories for the lambda function source code.</p>
</div>
<p>We created two Lambda functions to process the data from the edge node. If both
the scale and camera were controlled by a single Raspberry Pi, we could have
made it a single Lambda function. However, because the edge node was implemented
on two different computers, we had to create two Lambda functions for our
prototype.</p>
<div class="section" id="color-processing-lambda">
<h3>Color Processing Lambda</h3>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color-lambda</span></tt> function processed data from the camera. It used <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow">Pillow</a>
to process the image data, and used the root-mean-square formula to find the
dominant color. Since we were filtering out a white background, this formula was
better than the average because it compensates for any white in the object that
was accidentally filtered out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="weight-processing-lambda">
<h3>Weight Processing Lambda</h3>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weight-processing-lambda</span></tt> took the weight data, and attempted to match it
to the weights already stored in a database table. The algorithm was as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Take all of the weight data that is being sent from the WiiFit and calculate
the average weight.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Query a database pre-seeded with information about inventory items to get all
inventory items within 4kg of the measurement. (We could be much more
intelligent about this margin, but for the hackathon, we just hardcoded it.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Calculate a confidence that the item on the scale is indeed that object. We
used a very simple metric for this: the value of the PMF of a normal

The height of a normal distribution is not 1, so we had to multiply by a
factor (<span class="formula">1‚ÄÖ‚ÅÑ‚ÄÖ<i>k</i></span>) to convert it to a percentage.</p>

<h1>Industrial Scale Implementation</h1>
<p>Our hackathon prototype cut a lot of corners, however we designed our project
with scalability in mind. We began by thinking big-picture, and talked about
what a full scale implementation would look like.  We thought of a few scenarios
where this project could be used such as inter-warehouse use and rural areas
that currently have limited package tracking infrastructure. From these broad
goals, we chose a set of features which we thought would be a good
proof-of-concept, and that is what we implemented during the hackathon.</p>
<p>By starting with how this project may scale, we were able to make informed
decisions about the architecture of our system. We have already discussed some
of these scalability considerations in the context of how they affected our
overall system's architecture in the <a class="reference internal" href="#architecture">Architecture</a> section above. Here we
concentrate on some of the additional considerations and scenarios that arose
when we thought about how we might deploy this project at scale in industrial
environments, but which did not directly affect our system architecture choices.</p>
<div class="section" id="additional-sensors">
<h2>Additional Sensors</h2>
<p>We had a very limited set of sensors to work with, and they were not very
accurate. In a production environment, we would want to use much higher quality
sensors, and increase the number of sensors utilized.</p>
<p>One example of such a sensor is a barcode scanner. We could add that to our node
as a primary method for determining what an item is, and then use all of the
other metrics to ensure that the item is in fact what the barcode says it is.
The story that drove this was a warehouse scenario where these edge nodes are
deployed in many places throughout the warehouse. If a non-trustworthy worker
switched a barcode, or somehow the barcode just fell off in between two edge
nodes, there would be a clear paper-trail to identify the problem.</p>
<p>To support new sensors on a node, we would either create new Lambda functions,
or update existing ones to handle the new data. Since we utilize a
non-relational database, storing these additional metrics does not require any
database changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-versions-of-edge-nodes">
<h2>Multiple Versions of Edge Nodes</h2>
<p>We envision edge node deployments to remain for years. However, newer versions
of the edge nodes could be made in this time period. To handle these new
versions of edge nodes, while maintaining backwards compatibility, we would just
write new Lambda functions to handle the new nodes, and point the newer edge
nodes to the new Lambda function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="high-traffic-intensity">
<h2>High Traffic Intensity</h2>
<p>We want to be able to rapidly scale the computational power available depending
on the number of packages which need to be processed. Such a high volume would
be UPS warehouses during the holidays. In these scenarios, we would want the
infrastructure to scale automatically to meet the increased demand while
maintaining low latency.</p>
<p>Our plan for this scenario is to put the AWS Lambda functions into auto-scaling
groups so that we can utilize Amazon's infrastructure to scale the computational
power rapidly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-additional-data-analysis-methods">
<h2>Adding Additional Data Analysis Methods</h2>
<p>In the future, we may find new ways to analyze the raw data to give better
predictions about what item is being processed. To accommodate these new
methods, we merely have to update the Lambda functions.</p>
<p>A few examples of additional analysis methods include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Weight distribution over time.</strong> An example would be an item containing
liquid. The liquid may slosh around while on the scale, and cause the weight
distribution to change. This metric could potentially prevent someone from
replacing one item with an item with the same-weight, but different contents.</li>
<li><strong>Image recognition.</strong> We currently use the color to help identify the object,
however, this metric is not very good. We could use neural networks to do
complex image recognition to better identify the item being examined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of both of these analytics methods could be aided by the use of
perceptual hashes.</p>
<p>Since all of the computational power is concentrated in the Lambda compute
nodes, these computationally-intensive ML processes can be done on x86
processors and GPUs running on AWS infrastructure rather than on edge nodes
which may not even have a traditional processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improved-handling-and-traceability">
<h2>Improved Handling and Traceability</h2>
<p>Our project utilized DynamoDB to allow storage of arbitrary data associated with
a certain measurement. This is great for flexibility, but causes some problems
with tracking packages' movement through a warehouse as there is not really a
direct trail. To add this direct trail, we could either convert to a relational
database or use a hybrid approach where we have relational data for tracking the
package through time, and non-relational data to store the individual data
points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remote-supervision-of-edge-nodes">
<h2>Remote Supervision of Edge Nodes</h2>
<p>The edge nodes will not always be able to perfectly identify the object in
question. In these cases, a human may need to intervene. We could easily create
a system that would allow a human to remotely view the camera feed, move the
camera around, view the data gathered from the sensors and the confidences
generated by the Lambda compute node computations, and view historical data
about the item. The supervisor could then override the system, or even send out
a person to the floor to examine and resole the problem. This would allow for a
single supervisor to have a real-time picture of the state of the entire system,
and could reduce personnel overhead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customer-facing-applications">
<h2>Customer Facing Applications</h2>
<p>Having images of objects as they move through and between warehouses can greatly
improve the customer experience. Right now, for example, UPS gives tracking
information about a package, but it is not very detailed. If Wii-Track were
deployed throughout their warehouses, they could generate much more granular
data, and also provide images of the package to the customers.</p>
<p>We could implement web apps or native applications to present this data to
customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="business-process-improvement">
<h2>Business Process Improvement</h2>
<p>By collecting all of this data, businesses who deploy Wii-Track will be able to
identify and respond to problems in their warehouses, supply chains, personnel,
etc. more easily. For example, if a lot of items get lost or damaged between
node A and node B, there may be is a problem with the conveyor belt system which
causes items to get caught between two of them, and sometimes fall off.
Obviously this is not a good situation, but the source of the problem can be
identified quickly by inspecting the data from the nodes. This will reduce the
wasted time trying to find the problem.</p>
<p>We could create applications which notify supervisors of problems, and then
present the data that supervisors need to identify the problem.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Although Wii-Track is a prototype, its architecture is robust, and its
businesses applications are numerous. Our hackathon prototype implementation
provides a proof-of-concept for the idea and tested the viability of the system
architecture. We believe that with continued improvement, Wii-Track can be
turned into a viable product which can be deployed at scale.</p>
